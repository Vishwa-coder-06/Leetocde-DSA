Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Solution:(In recurssion , can also solved in 2 pointer)

class Solution {
public:
    void rev(int i,vector<char>& s,int n){
        if(i>=n/2)return;
        swap(s[i],s[n-i-1]);
        rev(i+1,s,n);
    }
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
         int n=s.size();
         rev(0,s,n);
        
    }
};

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
