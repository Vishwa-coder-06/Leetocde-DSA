You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int a=0;
        for(char i:s)
        a^=i;
        for(char j:t)
        a^=j;

        return a;
    }
};

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
